### Step-by-Step Guide to Running Jupyter Notebook as a Web App

#### 1. Setup Environment and Dependencies

Ensure that you have installed the following dependencies:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask
- Required supporting modules

#### 2. Convert Jupyter Notebook to Jupyter Dashboard

Convert the Jupyter Notebook (`file.ipynb`) into a Jupyter Dashboard using `voila`.

Install voila if it's not installed:
bash
pip install voila

voila file.ipynb

- This command will initiate a local server and automatically open the notebook as a web app.

#### 3. Integrate Dashboard into Flask Web App
app.py (Flask Application)
Add a route in the Flask application (app.py) to display the Jupyter Dashboard:


from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

# Route to display the Jupyter Dashboard
@app.route('/dashboard')
def show_dashboard():
    return render_template('dashboard.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
    
#### 4. Create HTML Template for Dashboard

templates/dashboard.html (HTML for Dashboard)
Create a file named dashboard.html inside the templates folder to display the Jupyter Dashboard:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Jupyter Dashboard</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Jupyter Dashboard</h1>
    <iframe src="http://localhost:8866/" width="100%" height="800px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</body>
</html>


#### 5. Run Flask App and Access Dashboard
Run the Flask application by executing app.py:
python app.py

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/dashboard. This will display the Jupyter Dashboard, previously converted from the notebook (file.ipynb) using voila.

Utilizing voila to convert the notebook into a dashboard and displaying it via a Flask application provides an interactive experience for running the code from your notebook through the web. Ensure all dependencies and necessary processing for APK detection are properly set within the notebook to execute correctly within the Jupyter Dashboard.
